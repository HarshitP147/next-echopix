# EchoPlix: guide for OpenAI Codex

This is an `Agents.md` file which acts as a guide for agents like OpenAI Codex and potentially other agents working at this codebase.

## Project Structure

- `root`: This is the root of the project which contains some config files for Next.js, TailwindCSS and the yarn package manager
    - `public`: Public folder which contains images and SVGs for the project. It also contains the main icon logo.
    - `src`:  The main source code of this project
        - `_data`: Folder which contains fake data for placeholders.
        - `app`: The main folder which contains the CSS file and dynamic file based routing using the app router of Next.js
        - `components`: Folder which contains the React components
            - `layout`: Big components which contain the structure of the webpage.
            - `medium`: Medium sized components which are to be used in layouts. Can be used for refactoring and splitting down bigger components.
            - `ui`: Mini components, most of which are generated by Shadcn/UI to be used anywhere in the app.
        - `lib`: Folder which contains utilies and library methods which can be reusable throughout the app.


## General conventions

- Use Typescript for all new code generation
- Follow the existing coding style in each file
- If the logic is too complex, add comments 

### React components
- Use function components along with hooks
- If the component grows too complex in a single file, split the logic wherever possible (e.g. postcard-image.tsx and postcard.tsx are split )
- All component props should be specified with their proptypes

### Styling components
- Use Shadcn/UI and TailwindCSS for generating CSS classes
- Use custom CSS only when extremely necessary
- Use framer motion for better animation wherever appropriate
